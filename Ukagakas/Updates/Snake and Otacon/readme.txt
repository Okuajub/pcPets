~~*Readme*~~
Hello! This is the Readme for the Snake and Otacon Ukagaka, created by Okuajub(devart Tiefking), Ver. 1.0.0
This is most likely your first installation of this Ghost. If not, thanks for sticking around!
Solid Snake and Otacon are from the Metal Gear Solid series. They will chat with each other, make references to their own media and others, comment on the time and date, and numerous small functions such as emptying the recycle bin or checking your email.
While Snake's sprite is based on his Shadow Moses sneaking suit, they really do not have much continuity in the universe.
There are two shells for this Ghost, one with Otacon's OtaClock/MGS2 sprites, the Retro Otacon shell, and one with my custom Otacon sprites, the Octopus shell, to match Snake's style. Which ever you prefer is fine, as they have the same AI.
~~*Spoiler and Trigger Warning*~~
This ghost contains spoilers for: Metal Gear Solid 1, Metal Gear Solid 2
This ghost contains references to past abuse and traumatic experiences sustained by the character(s). If subtle references to: Childhood Sexual Assault, Death, and Neglect, would trigger you, please refrain from using this Ghost. 
~~*Why Snake?*~~
I didn't see any Ukagakas created for MGS anywhere on the internet, so I decided to make one myself, as almost half the shell-work would be done for me with Otacon's MGS2 sprites (before I decided to create a second custom shell for him, hah).
I also thought that Snake and Otacon bounce off each other well, and I have a good feel of their personalities, so it wouldn't be grueling to write.
So, now we have this! Hurrah. Please enjoy Otacon telling Snake about Japanese animes.
~~*Why wasn't XYZ MGS character mentioned?*~~
I either forgot, have future plans for them, or didn't find them particularly relevant or in the knowledge of Snake or Otacon.
Specifically for Raiden, I want to have a sort of mini-storyline as I update these two, up until the point when I release a Raiden ghost ^^ but you'll have to wait and see on that one.
~~*Future Endeavors*~~
I hope to update Snake and Otacon with more dialogue, animations, and a friendship system.
I may consider making a Naked Snake and Ocelot Ghost, but as I don't know them nearly as well as Solid and Otacon, I'd most likely crowd-source the dialogue. If you would be interested in that, please send me a note on DA! Other MGS Ghosts I would be interested in are: Raiden and Emma, Venom Snake and Kaz, Big Boss(?)
As an amateur programmer, I may continue to update these two with special tidbits, however I wanted to get a basic, 1.0.0 version out before anything else, so we'd have a functional version before going overboard. I really enjoy programming these little guys, so look out for future versions!
Dialogue between Other MGS Ghosts (Requires them to be finished, first.) would be great, too.
~~*Special Thanks*~~
This Ghost would not be possible without the in-depth tutorial and template Zarla created for Ukagakas. A majority of the heavy-lifting was done by her.
