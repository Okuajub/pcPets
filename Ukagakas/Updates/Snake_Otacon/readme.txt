~~*Readme*~~
Hello! This is the Readme for the Snake and Otacon Ukagaka, created by Okuajub(devart Tiefking), Ver. 1.1.1
This is most likely your first installation of this Ghost. If not, thanks for sticking around!
Release Notes are updated on https://okuajub.github.io/pcPets/ and in changelog.txt. If your version is out of date, be sure to check there for the latest .nar file!
~~*Some Information*~~
Solid Snake and Otacon are from the Metal Gear Solid series. They will chat with each other, make references to their own media and others, comment on the time and date, and numerous small functions such as emptying the recycle bin or checking your email.
While Snake's sprite is based on his Shadow Moses sneaking suit, they really do not have much continuity in the universe. They may seem contradictory to the timeline, and that's okay! They're also sitting here on your computer... A little suspension of disbelief?
There are two shells for this Ghost, one with Otacon's OtaClock/MGS2 sprites, the Retro Otacon shell, and one with my custom Otacon sprites, the Solid shell, to match Snake's style. Which ever you prefer is fine, as they have the same AI. (Solid shell is still unreleased.)
~~*Spoiler and Trigger Warning*~~
This ghost contains spoilers for: Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, Metal Gear Solid 1, Metal Gear Solid 2, Metal Gear Solid 4
This ghost contains references to past abuse and traumatic experiences sustained by the character(s). If references to: Childhood Sexual Assault, Death, and Neglect, would trigger you, please refrain from using this Ghost. 
~~*Why Snake?*~~
I didn't see any Ukagakas created for MGS anywhere on the internet, so I decided to make one myself, as almost half the shell-work would be done for me with Otacon's MGS2 sprites (before I decided to create a second custom shell for him, hah. but that's still a WIP).
I also thought that Snake and Otacon bounce off each other well, and I have a good feel of their personalities, so it wouldn't be grueling to write.
So, now we have this! Hurrah. Please enjoy Otacon telling Snake about Japanese animes.
~~*Why wasn't XYZ MGS character mentioned?*~~
I either forgot, didn't want to, have future plans for them, or didn't find them particularly relevant or in the knowledge of Snake or Otacon.
Do not fear, I'm always up for new dialogue ideas. If you want them mentioned, feel free to send suggestions to Okuajub.Reports@protonmail.com
~~*Special Thanks*~~
This Ghost would not be possible without the in-depth tutorial and template Zarla created for Ukagakas. A majority of the heavy-lifting was done by her.

I also want to thank Zichqec in the Ukagaka community for their contributions and discoveries, and being extremely helpful and kind during my development of this ghost.
