~~*Readme*~~
Hello! This is the Readme for the Snake and Otacon Ukagaka, created by Okuajub(deviantart Tiefking), Ver. 1.2.1
This is most likely your first installation of this Ghost. If not, thanks for sticking around!
Release Notes are updated on https://okuajub.github.io/pcPets/ and in the included changelog.txt. If your version is out of date, be sure to check the github for the latest .nar file!
~~*Some Information*~~
Solid Snake and Otacon are from the Metal Gear Solid series. They will chat with each other, make references to their own media and others, comment on the time and date, and numerous small functions such as emptying the recycle bin or checking your email.
These two really do not have much continuity in the universe. They may seem contradictory to the timeline, and that's okay! They're also sitting here on your computer... A little suspension of disbelief?
There are two shells for this Ghost. The default is the most complex and most complete. The second included is a legacy shell from earlier development which includes Otacon's OtaClock/MGS2 sprites, the Retro Otacon shell. 
Which ever you prefer is fine, as they have the same AI. Please do be aware, however, that the Retro Otacon shell may cause issues with certain features in future development, as I am not currently maintaining it.
~~*Why Snake?*~~
I did not see any Ukagakas created for MGS anywhere on the internet, so I decided to make one myself, as almost half the shell-work would be done for me with Otacon's MGS2 sprites. That was before I decided to make a second, totally unique shell, haha.
I also thought that Snake and Otacon bounce off each other well, and I have a good feel of their personalities, so it wouldn't be grueling to write.
So, now we have this! Hurrah. Please enjoy Otacon telling Snake about Japanese animes.
~~*Why wasn't XYZ MGS character mentioned?*~~
I either forgot, didn't want to, have future plans for them, or didn't find them particularly relevant or in the knowledge of Snake or Otacon.
Do not fear, I'm always up for new dialogue ideas. If you want them mentioned, feel free to send suggestions to Okuajub.Reports@protonmail.com
~~*Special Thanks*~~
This Ghost would not be possible without the in-depth tutorial and template Zarla created for Ukagakas. A majority of the heavy-lifting was done by her template. Without it, I may never have made this ghost!

I also want to thank Zichqec in the Ukagaka community for her contributions and discoveries, and being extremely helpful and kind during my development of this ghost. She also converted this ghost to YAYA for me. Thank you!
