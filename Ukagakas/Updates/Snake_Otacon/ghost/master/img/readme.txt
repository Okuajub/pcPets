~~*img*~~
These images are used some place in the dialogue. 
To keep file size low, I kept all PNGs below 200px by 200px.
Remember, for all of these images, the *Top Left* pixel will be the transparent color for all these images. so, make it an odd color or transparent so it doesn't mess with the whole picture.
Sometimes, it wasn't really that noticable (codecmomentsdragonmotorcycle) so I let it be.
Codecmoments are lines of dialogue which are prompted by Otacon beginning with "So... Any Codec moments from you, Snake?" in a reference to the Taker mission from MGS2. They appear randomly.
I have many examples in the aitalk.dic which you can follow the formula with if you want to mod in your own Codec Moments.
The exception to this is the "wednesdayasuka" img, which, otacon will sometimes say on thursdays if i recall correctly.
