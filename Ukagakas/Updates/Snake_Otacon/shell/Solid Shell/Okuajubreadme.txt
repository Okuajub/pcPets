This is the Solid Shell. It features artwork to match Snake's.
Because these two don't fall in any particular place in continuity (and break it at times), their outfits are not indicative of how old they are, or where they came from.
This is why Otacon's Retro shell, from MGS2, has the same dialogue as Otacon's Solid Shell, which looks a bit like MGS1 and MGS2 Otacon.
If that bothers you for some reason, you're free to make a personal version which edits out any continuity breaking dialogue, or whatever, and can contact me on Deviantart if you'd like to work something out about publicly releasing an alternate version. but this is technically under creative commons, so, do whatever you want i'm not your dad lol

Surfaces 1500-1599 are Snake's Emote poses. Exception is surface0, default pose.
surface0 - Default 
surface1501 - Embarassed 
surface1502 - Surprised 
surface1503 - Hit/Punched 
surface1504 - Sad 
surface1505 - Smiling 
surface1506 - Content 
surface1507 - Angry 
surface1508 - Thoughtful 
surface1509 - Bored 
surface1510-1512 - Exiting to Bottom

the last two numbers of each surface corrosponds to it's SakuraScript call number.
E.G. \0\s[3] displays Snake's hit pose (0 in the tens place means there's nothing there. so 03 = 3)

Surfaces 2500-2599 are Otacon's Emote poses. Snake's last two numbers cheat won't work here. Sorry.
surface10 - Default
surface2501 - Embarassed 
surface2502 - Scared 
surface2503 - Worried 
surface2504 - Sad 
surface2505 - Smiling 
surface2506 - Content 
surface2507 - Angry 
surface2508 - Thoughtful 
surface2509 - Bored 
surface2510 - Blushing 

I sort of lied when I said the cheat wouldn't work. Just a half lie. You just need to modify it a bit.
For Otacon's first ten poses, you can add 10 to the number to get the SakuraScript call number.
E.G. we want Smiling, so that's surface 2505. Add ten, 2515, last two numbers, 15, so smiling is \1\s[15]!
Once we get to Blushing, however, that trick won't work. It'll call one of Snake's instead (his numbers go 0, 20, 40, etc.) and that looks quite odd.
Snake's surfaces all should have a height of 350 pixels and a width of 251 pixels. There is extra room for movement.
Otacon's Solid surfaces should all have a height of 225 pixels and a width of 320 pixels. There is extra room for movement.
