This is the Retro Otacon shell. It borrows some sprites for Otacon from Metal Gear Solid 2, that you'd see in the Tanker mission.
Retro Otacon's surfaces are scaled to be the same as Konami's official Otaclock, so 128 pixels tall.
If this bothers you, however, like you have them both open at the same time, there is the alternate shell which has drawings of Otacon that match Snake's artstyle.
Because these two don't fall in any particular place in continuity (and break it at times), their outfits are not indicative of how old they are, or where they came from.
If that bothers you for some reason, you're free to make a personal version which edits out any continuity breaking dialogue, and can contact me on Deviantart if you'd like to work something out about publicly releasing an alternate version.

Surfaces 1500-1599 are Snake's Emote poses. Exception is surface0, default pose.
surface0 - Default 
surface1501 - Embarassed 
surface1502 - Surprised 
surface1503 - Hit/Punched 
surface1504 - Sad 
surface1505 - Smiling 
surface1506 - Content 
surface1507 - Angry 
surface1508 - Thoughtful 
surface1509 - Bored 
surface1510-1512 - Exiting to Bottom

the last two numbers of each surface corrosponds to it's SakuraScript call number.
E.G. \0\s[3] displays Snake's hit pose (0 in the tens place means there's nothing there. so 03 = 3)

Surfaces 2500-2599 are Otacon's Emote poses. Snake's last two numbers cheat won't work here. Sorry.
surface10 - Default
surface2501 - Embarassed 
surface2502 - Scared 
surface2503 - Worried 
surface2504 - Sad 
surface2505 - Smiling 
surface2506 - Content 
surface2507 - Angry 
surface2508 - Thoughtful 
surface2509 - Bored 
surface2510 - Blushing 

I sort of lied when I said the cheat wouldn't work. Just a half lie. You just need to modify it a bit.
For Otacon's first ten poses, you can add 10 to the number to get the SakuraScript call number.
E.G. we want Smiling, so that's surface 2505. Add ten, 2515, last two numbers, 15, so smiling is \1\s[15]!
Once we get to Blushing, however, that trick won't work. It'll call one of Snake's instead (his numbers go 0, 20, 40, etc.) and that looks quite odd.
Snake's surfaces all should have a height of 350 pixels and a width of 251 pixels. There is extra room for movement.
Otacon's Retro surfaces should all have a height of 184 pixels and a width of 162 pixels. There is extra room for movement.
