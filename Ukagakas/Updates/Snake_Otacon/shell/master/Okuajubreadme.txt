This is the Solid Shell for Snake and Otacon. It is a complete rework of both Snake and Otacon to replace their programmer art with something more appealing.
IT IS ALSO VERY FINICKY AND UNSTABLE, the dressup system is.. kind of crazy. so be VERY MINDFUL if you change anything in the code.
Snake and Otacon here are supposed to be in a sort of faux cheap anime style, with inspiration from Yugioh and others in that vein, although they have realistic porportions because I prefer it. 
This cell shading and clean color style helped me work faster and longer, so it served a dual purpose, also.
Because these two don't fall in any particular place in MGS continuity (and break it at times), their outfits are not indicative of how old they are, or where they came from. 
You can even switch between Snake and Pliskin. 
This is why Otacon's Retro shell, from MGS2, has the same dialogue as Otacon's Solid Shell, which looks a bit like MGS1 and MGS2 Otacon, but Snake is from Shadow Moses. It doesn't really mean anything.
If that bothers you for some reason, you're free to make a personal version which edits out any continuity breaking dialogue, or whatever.
Maybe I'll set a chronological mode sometime. who knows?
you can contact me on Deviantart if you'd like to work something out about publicly releasing an alternate version. But this is also technically under creative commons, so, do whatever you want.
Also, forgive my poor katakana handwriting skill.. (;￣︶￣)
Now, onto the explanation of this shell.

suface0 - "blank" image for Snake's clothing dressups to layer over. (if you're curious and can't read it, the katakana says "David".) 
I did it this way because I didn't want to have to layer all the clothes over either Shadow Moses or Pliskin clothing, because it'd be bulky fast.

Surfaces 1500-1599 are Snake's Shadow Moses clothes poses, with the exception of 3031 which is his default pose. 
The reason these are numbered differently is because ~1500 was the default in his old shell, and it's easier to adjust the old surfaces to be dressups than rename every file.
surface3031 - Default 
surface1501 - Embarassed 
surface1502 - Surprised 
surface1503 - Hit/Punched 
surface1504 - Sad

surface1506 - Content 
surface1507 - Angry 
surface1508 - Thoughtful 
surface1509 - Bored 
surface1510-1512 - Exiting to Bottom

surface3501-3512 are the same as above but for the Navy SEAL disguise.

Surfaces 2500-2599 are Otacon's untucked worn shirt. Same reasons the numbers are different for this one. Easier to overwrite than rename blah blah

35xx - I accidentally overlapped this one's numbering system with Snake's SEAL dressup, so it's going to be a little weird. but, its backend so you don't have to worry about it.
