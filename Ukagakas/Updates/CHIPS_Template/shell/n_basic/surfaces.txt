//This is the alternate shell for these characters. It's called 'basic' because I wanted to show really how simple you can go.

//surface0 is the default pose. It will have the most animations, usually, but to make this easy to use I have only included two: Blinking and talking. If you don't understand the code, please read it carefully and look at the files in the shell\master folder.
//If you don't care about animations, and would just like to replace the images and move on, go ahead and comment out any line starting with 'animation'.
//You can create a comment by writing two backslashes, like at the beginning of this sentence.
//With that commented out, you can replace the images with whatever PNGs you'd like. Just make sure the file names are the same!
