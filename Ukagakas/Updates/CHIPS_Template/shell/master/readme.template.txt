Hello! This is the place where you'll put all the visuals for your Ghost. These images are intended to be replaced, so please do not redistribute them without permission.

If you are familiar with SERIKO coding (shell coding), then this will be very easy for you. If not, I'll point you to some helpful resources when it comes to SERIKO.

https://ukagakadreamteam.com/wiki/info/seriko is a brief overview of what SERIKO is. I suggest reading it even if you don't want to do anything complex.

https://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/makingimages.html is the beginning of the Shell portion of the Girl and Triangle template walkthrough. If you just want the basics and don't want to get too complicated, this is perfect for that.

https://ssp.shillest.net/ukadoc/manual/descript_shell_surfaces.html If you'd like to do more complicated work, this page is the official documentation for SERIKO and should hold all the information you need. You can run it through a translator if you don't understand Japanese (which is understandable considering the audience for this Ghost), but if it looks like too much for you, then that's OK. The walkthrough listed before this one is a great point to go from and you can do a lot with the info it gives you.
