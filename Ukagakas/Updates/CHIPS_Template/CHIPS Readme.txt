Hello! This is the CHIPS Kawari Template.
CHIPS is unique in that it acts as a middleman between you, and the SHIORI. You shouldn't have to know any Kawari to use CHIPS, although to the make the most use of it knowing a little helps.
If you don't know where to start, I suggest moving onto the 'ghost\master' folder. You'll find the next readme there!
